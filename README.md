bass drum instrument - Max for Live

A bass drum generated by a wavetable impulse. Choose from 3 different wavetables : "doum", "hump" and "tumf". Velocity controls the attack and the filter resonance, making it very expressive just with velocity automations from Live. The other controls are for the filter enveloppe "slide" and the overdrive amount.
when OD is at minimum and you apply some slide, be careful of your output gain ! Use gain reduction control. 
part of the bassdrum code is derived from "mmWmm 6" by Iftah Gabbai https://cycling74.com/articles/micro-music-with-max-by-iftah-gabbai
